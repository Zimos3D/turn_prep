/**
 * Roll Handler
 * 
 * Integrates with Foundry's native roll system.
 * When user clicks "Roll" button for an action/feature, this handles it.
 * Hooks into the same roll system as the native character sheet.
 * 
 * TODO: Implement:
 * - triggerItemRoll(actor, item, event): Trigger Foundry's native roll for an item
 * - This should show the native "Normal/Advantage/Disadvantage" dialog
 * - Handle roll output to chat
 * - Handle errors gracefully
 * - Reuse Foundry's native roll logic (don't reinvent)
