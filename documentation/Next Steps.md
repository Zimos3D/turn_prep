I've got all of the basics working. 

# Tweaks and fixes

## Sidebar
- Make Sidebar cards collapsible and collapsed by default. Opening shows features like it is now but still not the other fields like notes. When 

- Drag and drop reordering of the favorite cards (but not history cards, of course)

- Also add "arrange" options  to the Context menu. for the favorite cards (move up, down, top, bottom) like before


# Features

- Search field to add features
    - Inserted into feature table headers
    - Filters based on the table it's attached to

- Add to turn prep context menu
    - Default routing is working fine. 
    
    - Optional submenu options to add directly to a specific plan, filtered by activity types

    - Change Default for new plans to put them at the top so that they are the default recipient of sent features.

- Collapsible favorites
    - Turns out they can get chonky pretty quick.



# Additional Sheets

## Default Sheet

I'd really like to support the default system sheet. This will be a big project and will likely lead to some refactoring of the existing codebase but it'll be worth it. 

I'll need to spend some more time looking at the default sheet and make a detailed plan for this. 

## NPC Sheets

I would love to be able to use this for my NPCs. It'll take some modification, but I think it will be doable.
1. Tidy5e NPC sheet
2. Default NPC Sheet
3. Tidy5e Classic NPC Sheet


## Tidy5e Classic

We'll see if I decide to bother with this
